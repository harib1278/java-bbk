Project commits have been made to the development branch 1.0 and then merged into master. This is to allow for ease of reversal of potentially bad commits as per a normal Git Workflow.

The final couple of commits were made AFTER the 1.0 to master branch was merged and just consists of some more light annotation. If continuing with this project one must merge the MASTER branch
in with the 1.0 to bring the latest changes into the 1.0 version branch.
